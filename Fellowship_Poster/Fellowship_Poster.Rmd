# Goals and Description

-   Create Shiny App to scrape student evaluation data from PDFs and provide a more in-depth analysis of the data by providing appropriate visuals

-   Model and predict ordinal responses based on student class year and sex

**Process**

1.  Scrape data from summary reports

2.  Wrangle data and construct visualizations

3.  Write functions for data scraping and wrangling

4.  Build and test Shiny App

5.  Fit ordinal logistic regression model and visualize

# Likert Scale Data

-   SLU student evaluations use a 7-point Likert scale, which refers to the set of potential responses ranging from *Strongly Disagree* to *Strongly Agree*

-   Likert scale data is best analyzed and interpreted through visualizations, such as Heatmaps or Bar Plots, rather than mean score of responses

```{r, out.width = "1150px", fig.align = "center"}
library(tidyverse)
year_label <- as_labeller(c
                ('1' = "Year 1",
                '2' = "Year 2"))
toy_df <- tibble(year = c(rep(1, 5), rep(2, 5)),
                 resp = rep(c("Agree", "Agree somewhat", "Neutral",
                              "Disagree somewhat", "Disagree"), 2),
                 n_resp = c(5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 
                            0, 2, 11, 2, 0)) |>
  mutate(resp = fct_inorder(resp))
ggplot(data = toy_df, aes(x = resp, y = n_resp)) +
  geom_col(colour = "black", fill = "lightblue") +
  facet_wrap(~year,
             labeller = year_label) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Response", y = "Number of Students",
       title = "Example Distribution using Likert Scale Data") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

-   The mean of both data sets is the same (3 points, or Neutral) but the distributions are very different

-   Using the average from these two data sets fails to communicate what was actually reported by participants, illustrating the danger of using the averages of Likert Scale data

# Shiny App Tabs

```{r, out.width = "1150px", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("multiple_tab.png")
knitr::include_graphics("single_tab.png")
knitr::include_graphics("diff_scale_tab.png")
knitr::include_graphics("tables_tab.png")
```

# Modeling: Ordinal Logistic Regression

-   An ordinal logistic regression model was fitted by using student-by-student data to predict and visualize the probability of student responses based on class year and sex
