# Goal and Description

-   Create Shiny App to scrape student evaluation data from PDFs and provide a more in-depth analysis of the data by providing appropriate visuals

-   Model and predict ordinal responses based on student class year and sex

**Process**

1.  Scrape data from summary reports

2.  Wrangle data and construct visualizations

3.  Write functions for data scraping and wrangling

4.  Build and test Shiny App

# Likert Scale Data

-   SLU student evaluations use a 7-point Likert scale, which refers to the set of potential responses to different statements ranging from *Strongly Disagree* to *Strongly Agree*

- Example statement: *The instructor was an effective teacher*

-   Likert scale data is best analyzed and interpreted through visualizations, such as Heatmaps or Bar Plots, rather than mean score of responses

```{r, out.width = "1225px", fig.align = "center"}
library(tidyverse)
year_label <- as_labeller(c
                ('1' = "Year 1",
                '2' = "Year 2"))
toy_df <- tibble(year = c(rep(1, 7), rep(2, 7)),
                 resp = rep(c("Strongly Agree", "Agree", "Agree somewhat", "Neutral",
                              "Disagree somewhat", "Disagree", "Strongly Disagree"), 2),
                 n_resp = c(0, 13, 1, 0, 1, 13, 0,
                            1, 2, 3, 16, 3, 2, 1)) |>
  mutate(resp = fct_inorder(resp))
ggplot(data = toy_df, aes(x = resp, y = n_resp)) +
  geom_col(colour = "black", fill = "#440154") +
  facet_wrap(~year,
             labeller = year_label) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Response", y = "Number of Students",
       title = "Example Distribution using Likert Scale Data") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) 
```

-   The mean of both data sets is the same (4 points, or Neutral) but the distributions are very different

-   Using the average from these two data sets fails to communicate what was actually reported by participants, illustrating the danger of using the averages of Likert Scale data

# Shiny App Tabs

```{r, out.width = "1050px", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("multiple_tab.png")
knitr::include_graphics("single_tab.png")
knitr::include_graphics("diff_scale_tab.png")
knitr::include_graphics("tables_tab.png")
# <div align = "center">*Also features a home tab with project description and GitHub link*
```

# Modeling with Ordinal Logistic Regression

-   Fitted ordinal logistic regression model to predict and visualize probability of student responses based on student class year and sex
