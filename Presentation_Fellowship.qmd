## Student Evaluation Data 

![Evaluation Data Example](page_2.jpg)

## Likert Scale Data 

```{r}
# show why means of likert scale data is bad 
library(tidyverse)
mock_df <- tibble(year = c(rep(1, 5), rep(2, 5)),
                  resp = rep(c("Agree", "Agree Somewhat", "Neutral",
                               "Disagree Somewhat", "Disagree"), 2),
                  n_resp = c(5, 2, 1, 2, 5,
                             0, 2, 12, 1, 0)) |>
  mutate(resp = fct_inorder(resp))

ggplot(data = mock_df, aes(x = resp, y = n_resp)) +
  geom_col(colour = "black", fill = "blue") +
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "response", y = "number of students")
```

## Process

-   Scrape data from pdf into R
-   Wrangle the data 
-   Construct visualizations 
-   Write functions for data scraping/wrangling 
-   Build and test shiny app 

## Shiny App


## Moving Forward 

-   More visualizations 
-   Allow for multiple pdf files to be uploaded at once
